## Project Overview: CPU Scheduling Visualization Simulator

This project, developed for our Operating Systems class under **Engr. Violdan E. Bayocot**, is a Java-based simulation tool that visually demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms. The simulator aims to help users understand how scheduling strategies affect process execution, turnaround time, and waiting time.

The system provides an interactive graphical interface using **Java Swing**, where users can:

- Add or generate random processes with arrival time, execution time, and priority
- Choose from common scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- Visualize execution through a dynamic Gantt chart
- Monitor process status, completion, and performance metrics in real time

This educational tool aims to enhance the understanding of CPU scheduling behavior through hands-on experimentation and immediate visual feedback.

## Objectives

- Illustrate how different CPU scheduling algorithms work
- Strengthen understanding of OS concepts like turnaround time, waiting time, and context switching
- Provide a user-friendly, visual tool for teaching and experimentation

---

## Features

- Java Swing GUI with real-time visualization
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin (with configurable quantum), MLFQ 
- Live Gantt chart updates and process status tracking
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Random or manual process generation
- Displays average turnaround time, waiting time, and total execution time
